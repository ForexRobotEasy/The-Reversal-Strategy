# The Reversal Strategy Forex Software ReadMe

This code represents the implementation of the Reversal Strategy Forex Software developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This software aims to optimize trade entry on white charts by identifying important levels known as BSL (Buy Stop Loss) and SSL (Sell Stop Loss). It analyzes price movements and predicts if the price will move towards the SSL level.

## Trade Entry Optimization

The `IdentifyBSL_SSL()` function is responsible for identifying the BSL and SSL levels on white charts. It uses specific algorithms to determine these levels.

The `DetermineEntryPoints()` function is used to determine the optimal trade entry points based on the identified BSL and SSL indications.

The `SuggestEntryLevels(double price)` function suggests entry levels when the price touches the identified BSL. In this code, it suggests an entry level 1% above the identified BSL.

## Trade Decision-making

The `PredictPriceMovement()` function analyzes price movements and predicts if it will move towards the SSL level. In this code, it always returns `true` to indicate a predicted movement towards the SSL level.

The `AdviseTrade()` function advises traders to take the trade when the price is predicted to move towards the SSL level.

The `CalculatePotentialProfits(double entryPrice)` function calculates potential profits at the SSL level. In this code, it calculates potential profits as 2% above the entry price.

## Technical Setup

The `Setup()` function facilitates the setup process for the Reversal Strategy Forex software.

The `ConfigureSoftware()` function contains necessary functions to configure the software according to user preferences.

## Main Function

The `OnTick()` function is the main function that is executed on every tick. It performs the following steps:

1. Calls the `IdentifyBSL_SSL()` and `DetermineEntryPoints()` functions to identify the BSL and SSL levels and determine optimal trade entry points.
2. Retrieves the current price using `MarketInfo()` for the current symbol.
3. Calls the `SuggestEntryLevels()` function to suggest an entry level based on the current price.
4. If the current price is greater than or equal to the suggested entry level:
    - Calls the `PredictPriceMovement()` function to analyze price movements and predict if it will move towards the SSL level.
    - If the predicted movement is towards the SSL level, calls the `AdviseTrade()` function.
    - Calls the `CalculatePotentialProfits()` function to calculate potential profits at the SSL level.
    - Executes the trade and manages the position (code not provided).
